            <p>
                At our elementary school, we believe that athletics play an essential role in promoting physical health, teamwork, and discipline. Our athletics program encourages students to participate in a variety of sports and physical activities that foster lifelong fitness habits and sportsmanship. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a focus on both individual and team sports, students develop coordination, confidence, and a positive attitude toward healthy competition. Regular physical education classes and after-school practices ensure that every student has the opportunity to engage and thrive.
